                <li>You must have worked with at least one other club member!</li>
                <li>Submissions must be 5.5 by 8.5 inches. Account for color bleed (ie have a white border or put nothing important close to the edge)</li>
                <li>1 to 5 pages, not including a title page. You can make a title page, otherwise (a boring) one will be provided. If an additional page is needed talk to the officers to see if it can be fit in</li>
                <li>Please work in 300 dpi and in CMYK. If you are confused about CMYK, click <a href="cmyk.html">here</a></li>
                <li>Turn submission into car2ncollab@bsu.edu by due date (end of fall semester or mid March for spring semester). Anyone who followed all guidelines will be published in the zine, and anyone published gets a free copy of the printed zine! You can have it in your hands!</li>
