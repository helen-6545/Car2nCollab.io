    <p>The club was founded in fall 2019 (I think) and And So it Begins was published in the same semester.</p>
    <p>Spring 2020 shut down the university and all student organizations.</p>
    <p>Attendance, and subsequently submissions took a huge hit, and we didnâ€™t publish again until the spring of 2023, with The Second Serving.</p>
    <p>We then published again last year, Prism Break in the spring of 2024. For this reason we are super motivated to publish this year!! Twice could be a fluke, three times means we can finally say, with no caveats, that we publish yearly!</p></div>
